h2(#help-section01). Plugin requirements

yab_email’s minimum requirements:

* Textpattern 4.x
* PHP > 5.2.0 is recommended

If you are running a PHP version 5.2.0 or above so the attribute @zip="1"@ will try to create the zip on harddisk instead in memory. If you have php 5.2.0 or above and you have problems with some restrictions like safe_mode, open_basedir etc., so try the attribute @zip="2"@. This will force the zip creation in memory.
